# In order to win the prize for most cookies sold, my friend Alice and I are going to merge our Girl Scout Cookies orders and enter as one unit

Each order is represented by an "order id" (an integer).

We have our lists of orders sorted numerically already, in  arrays. Write a  function  to merge our  arrays of orders into one sorted  array.

For example:

    const myArray = [3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 15];
    const alicesArray = [1, 5, 8, 12, 14, 19];
    
    console.log(mergeArrays(myArray, alicesArray));
    // logs [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19]

### Gotchas

We can do this in  O(n) time and space.

If you're running a built-in sorting  function, your algorithm probably takes  O(n\lg{n})O(nlgn)  time for that sort.

**Think about edge cases!**  What happens when we've merged in all of the elements from one of our  arrays but we still have elements to merge in from our other  array?

### Breakdown

We could simply concatenate (join together) the two  arrays into one, then sort the result:

    function mergeSortedArrays(myArray, alicesArray) {
      const mergedArray = myArray.concat(alicesArray);
      return mergedArray.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    }


What would the time cost be?

O(n\lg{n}), where  n  is the total length of our output  array  (the sum of the lengths of our inputs).

We can do better. With this algorithm, we're not really taking advantage of the fact that the input  arrays are themselves  _already sorted_. How can we save time by using this fact?

A good general strategy for thinking about an algorithm is to try writing out a sample input and performing the operation by hand. If you're stuck, try that!

Since our  arrays are sorted, we know they each have their smallest item in the 0th index.  **So the smallest item overall is in the 0th index of one of our input  arrays!**

_Which_  0th element is it? Whichever is smaller!

To start, let's just write a  function  that chooses the  _0th_  element for our sorted  array.

    function mergeArrays(myArray, alicesArray) {
    
      const mergedArray = [];
    
      const headOfMyArray = myArray[0];
      const headOfAlicesArray = alicesArray[0];
    
      // Case: 0th comes from my array
      if (headOfMyArray < headOfAlicesArray) {
        mergedArray[0] = headOfMyArray;
    
        // Case: 0th comes from Alice's array
      } else {
        mergedArray[0] = headOfAlicesArray;
      }
    
      // Eventually we'll want to return the merged array
      return mergedArray;
    }

Okay, good start! That works for finding the 0th element. Now how do we choose the next element?

Let's look at a sample input:

    [3,  4,  6, 10, 11, 15]  // myArray
    [1,  5,  8, 12, 14, 19]  // alicesArray



To start we took the 0th element from  alicesArray  and put it in the 0th slot in the output  array:

    [3,  4,  6, 10, 11, 15]  // myArray
    [1,  5,  8, 12, 14, 19]  // alicesArray
    [1,  x,  x,  x,  x,  x]  // mergedArray

We need to make sure we don't try to put that 1 in  mergedArray  again. We should mark it as "already merged" somehow. For now, we can just cross it out:

    [3,  4,  6, 10, 11, 15]  // myArray
    [x,  5,  8, 12, 14, 19]  // alicesArray
    [1,  x,  x,  x,  x,  x]  // mergedArray


Or we could even imagine it's removed from the  array:

    [3,  4,  6, 10, 11, 15]  // myArray
    [5,  8, 12, 14, 19]      // alicesArray
    [1,  x,  x,  x,  x,  x]  // mergedArray


Now to get our next element we can use the same approach we used to get the 0th element—it's the smallest of the  _earliest unmerged elements_  in either  array! In other words, it's the smaller of the leftmost elements in either  array, assuming we've removed the elements we've already merged in.

So in general we could say something like:

1.  We'll start at the beginnings of our input  arrays, since the smallest elements will be there.
2.  As we put items in our final  mergedArray, we'll keep track of the fact that they're "already merged."
3.  At each step, each  array  has a  _first_  "not-yet-merged" item.
4.  At each step, the next item to put in the  mergedArray  is the smaller of those two "not-yet-merged" items!

Can you implement this in code?

    function mergeArrays(myArray, alicesArray) {
    
      const mergedArray = [];
    
      let currentIndexAlices = 0;
      let currentIndexMine = 0;
      let currentIndexMerged = 0;
    
      while (currentIndexMerged < (myArray.length + alicesArray.length)) {
        const firstUnmergedAlices = alicesArray[currentIndexAlices];
        const firstUnmergedMine = myArray[currentIndexMine];
    
        // Case: next comes from my array
        if (firstUnmergedMine < firstUnmergedAlices) {
          mergedArray[currentIndexMerged] = firstUnmergedMine;
          currentIndexMine++;
    
          // Case: next comes from Alice's array
        } else {
          mergedArray[currentIndexMerged] = firstUnmergedAlices;
          currentIndexAlices++;
        }
    
        currentIndexMerged++;
      }
    
      return mergedArray;
    }

Okay, this algorithm makes sense. To wrap up, we should think about edge cases and check for bugs. What edge cases should we worry about?

Here are some edge cases:

1.  One or both of our input  arrays is 0 elements or 1 element
2.  One of our input  arrays is longer than the other.
3.  One of our  arrays runs out of elements before we're done merging.

Actually, (3) will  _always_  happen. In the process of merging our  arrays, we'll certainly exhaust one before we exhaust the other.

Does our  function  handle these cases correctly?

If both arrays are empty, we're fine. But for all the other edge cases, at some point firstUnmergedMine or firstUnmergedAlices will be undefined because there won't be an element at one of those indices. Then JavaScript will compare undefined with a number, which will always be false, and mergedArray might be out of order or contain undefined!

How can we fix this?

We can probably solve these cases at the same time. They're not so different—they just have to do with indexing past the end of  arrays.

To start, we could treat each of our  arrays being out of elements as a separate case to handle, in addition to the 2 cases we already have. So we have 4 cases total. Can you code that up?

Be sure you check the cases in the right order!

    function mergeArrays(myArray, alicesArray) {
    
      const mergedArray = [];
    
      let currentIndexAlices = 0;
      let currentIndexMine = 0;
      let currentIndexMerged = 0;
    
      while (currentIndexMerged < (myArray.length + alicesArray.length)) {
    
        // Case: my array is exhausted
        if (currentIndexMine >= myArray.length) {
          mergedArray[currentIndexMerged] = alicesArray[currentIndexAlices];
          currentIndexAlices++;
    
          // Case: Alice's array is exhausted
        } else if (currentIndexAlices >= alicesArray.length) {
          mergedArray[currentIndexMerged] = myArray[currentIndexMine];
          currentIndexMine++;
    
          // Case: my item is next
        } else if (myArray[currentIndexMine] < alicesArray[currentIndexAlices]) {
          mergedArray[currentIndexMerged] = myArray[currentIndexMine];
          currentIndexMine++;
    
          // Case: Alice's item is next
        } else {
          mergedArray[currentIndexMerged] = alicesArray[currentIndexAlices];
          currentIndexAlices++;
        }
    
        currentIndexMerged++;
      }
    
      return mergedArray;
    }

Cool. This'll work, but it's a bit repetitive. We have these two lines twice:

    mergedArray[currentIndexMerged] = myArray[currentIndexMine];
    currentIndexMine++;

Same for these two lines:

    mergedArray[currentIndexMerged] = alicesArray[currentIndexAlices];
    currentIndexAlices++;

That's not  DRY. Maybe we can avoid repeating ourselves by bringing our code back down to just 2 cases.

See if you can do this in just one "if else" by combining the conditionals.

You might try to simply squish the middle cases together:

    if (isAlicesArrayExhausted ||
      (myArray[currentIndexMine] < alicesArray[currentIndexAlices])) {
    
      mergedArray[currentIndexMerged] = myArray[currentIndexMine];
      currentIndexMine++;

But what happens when  myArray  is exhausted?

myArray[currentIndexMine]  will be  undefined. But our code will still work! JavaScript gives  false  for any comparison with  undefined, and we  _want_  false here—we're checking if the element in  myArray  comes first, and it  _doesn't_  if  myArray  is empty. But this code wouldn't work in many other languages—we'd get an error when we tried to access an element in an empty array or compare a number with a non-numerical value like  undefined.

Even though our code  _works_, it's messy to access and compare an element that doesn't exist. Let's adjust our code so we're more explicit and don't rely on JavaScript's uncommon and nonobvious behavior of giving  false  in comparisons with  undefined.

### Solution

First, we allocate our answer  array, getting its size by adding the size of  myArray  and  alicesArray.

We keep track of a current index in  myArray, a current index in  alicesArray, and a current index in  mergedArray. So at each step, there's a "current item" in  alicesArray  and in  myArray. The smaller of those is the next one we add to the  mergedArray!

**But careful: we also need to account for the case where we exhaust one of our  arrays and there are still elements in the other**. To handle this, we say that the current item in  myArray  is the next item to add to  mergedArray  only if  myArray  is  _not_  exhausted AND, either:

1.  alicesArray  is exhausted, or
2.  the current item in  myArray  is less than the current item in  alicesArray

	    function mergeArrays(myArray, alicesArray) {
	    
	      // Set up our mergedArray
	      const mergedArray = [];
	    
	      let currentIndexAlices = 0;
	      let currentIndexMine = 0;
	      let currentIndexMerged = 0;
	    
	      while (currentIndexMerged < (myArray.length + alicesArray.length)) {
	    
	        const isMyArrayExhausted = currentIndexMine >= myArray.length;
	        const isAlicesArrayExhausted = currentIndexAlices >= alicesArray.length;
	    
	        // Case: next comes from my array
	        // My array must not be exhausted, and EITHER:
	        // 1) Alice's array IS exhausted, or
	        // 2) The current element in my array is less
	        //    than the current element in Alice's array
	        if (!isMyArrayExhausted && (isAlicesArrayExhausted ||
	          (myArray[currentIndexMine] < alicesArray[currentIndexAlices]))) {
	    
	          mergedArray[currentIndexMerged] = myArray[currentIndexMine];
	          currentIndexMine++;
	    
	          // Case: next comes from Alice's array
	        } else {
	          mergedArray[currentIndexMerged] = alicesArray[currentIndexAlices];
	          currentIndexAlices++;
	        }
	    
	        currentIndexMerged++;
	      }
	    
	      return mergedArray;
	    }

The if statement is carefully constructed to avoid indexing past the end of an array, because JavaScript would give us undefined and we don't want to compare undefined with an integer. We take advantage of JavaScript's short circuit evaluation  ↴ and check _first_ if the arrays are exhausted.

### Complexity

O(n)  time and  O(n)  additional space, where  nn  is the number of items in the merged  array.

The added space comes from allocating the  mergedArray. There's no way to do this " in place"  ↴ because neither of our input  arrays are necessarily big enough to hold the merged  array.

But if our inputs were linked lists, we could avoid allocating a new structure and do the merge by simply adjusting the  next  pointers in the list nodes!

In our implementation above, we could avoid tracking  currentIndexMerged  and just compute it on the fly by adding  currentIndexMine  and  currentIndexAlices. This would only save us one integer of space though, which is hardly anything. It's probably not worth the added code complexity.

### Bonus

What if we wanted to merge  _several_  sorted  arrays? Write a  function  that takes as an input  _an array  of sorted  arrays_  and outputs a single sorted  array  with all the items from each  array.

Do we absolutely have to allocate a new  array  to use for the merged output? Where else could we store our merged  array? How would our  function  need to change?

### What We Learned

We spent a lot of time figuring out how to cleanly handle edge cases.

Sometimes it's easy to lose steam at the end of a coding interview when you're debugging. But keep sprinting through to the finish! Think about edge cases. Look for off-by-one errors.
